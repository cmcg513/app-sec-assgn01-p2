This project denotes my submission for Assignment 01 Part 02. Included you'll find driectories for each of the sandboxes I attacked. Inside most, you'll find the attacks I found that were successful as well as a README explaining my methodology. You will also find two PDFs. One gives a high level description of each sandbox, and the other summarizes my work and findings.
